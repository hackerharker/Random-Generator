# Random-Generator

## Summary

As a landscape architect I often need to develop multiple iterations of paving patterns, score joint patterning and other various decorative patterning that is intended to look 'random'. Because I am interested in developing tools for landscape architects (including myself) to use, I wanted to experiment with how I could use JavaScript to help me in the process of developing iterative patterning. This particular random generator is based of a grid of rectangular units. Variations in spacing along the x-axis creates a pattern of chasms that is regenerated each time the 'show me!' button is pressed. The framework of this code could also be adapted to other types of patterning.
